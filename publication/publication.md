# Notes

* Start with "so, you are getting ready to submit your paper..."
* Exercise: Catalog the things you have from the workshop
  * where do they currently live?
  * what needs to be published?
  * how many are already published?
* What still needs to happen?
  * Published need not mean archived: availability and access for
    perpetuity.
  * Published need not mean easily citable, and easily trackable for
    impact: acquire persistent identifier that is broadly supported in
    scholarly communication.
  * Completeness is a judgment call: which parts are needed to
    understand, judge, and recreate the results reported in the paper. 
* For whom does this need to happen?
  * Collaborators
  * Peer reviewers, journal editors
  * Broad scientific community, or generally the public
* Is it ready for public consumption?
  * Are things in which copyright vests properly licensed for reuse
    (and why does this matter)?
  * Is there an appropriate amount of documentation? READMEs etc.
  * Are there sufficient metadata for each component?
